# Proofly â€” Verifiable Credentials Demo

Proofly is a **client-side React demo** that allows colleges to mint verifiable certificates, and students to securely view them. Certificates can be verified instantly via a hash or QR code. This demo is fully **client-side** but structured to be **blockchain-ready** for future integration with Aptos or other smart contract platforms.
